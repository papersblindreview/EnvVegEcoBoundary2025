# Biome Boundary

Supplemental codes for "Modeling Midwestern Prairie-Forest Ecotone and Environment-Vegetation Feedback with a Hierarchical Bayesian Model".

There are three scripts in the code folder:

1) `functions.py` contains helper functions to load and preprocess the data
2) `model.py` contains code to run the hierarchical Bayesian model
3) `model_val.py` contains code to interpolate in space
